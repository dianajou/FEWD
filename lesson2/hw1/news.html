				<h3>News</h3>

				<p>August 20, 2012</p>
				<p>There's a kind of guilelessness to Miami: If you're roaming around wondering if everyone is bullshitting you, they're not. South Beach has a famously hedonistic vein-- all that cocaine and wantonness-- but there's an earnestness to this place, too, a commitment to pleasure,  pleasantries, and poolside cocktails delivered on little bamboo trays. Stay up, Miami seems to say. Don't look down. Don't look back.
So what's Chan Marshall doing here? It's a reasonable thing to wonder. 
Performing as Cat Power, Marshall has spent the last two decades cultivating an indelible reputation for despondency, particularly while onstage: she will wander off mid-set or whisper to persons unseen, she will slug from splits of Jack Daniel's or turn her back on an audience, curling up like a pillbug. She apologizes an awful lot. There's something about the way her behavior is discussed that feels nearly if not entirely sexist-- it's rooted in hysteria, not genius; it's a function of fragility, not self-possession. Then again, there have been hospitalizations.
Such are the pains of art-making, all the clich√©s we assume about this particular trade: the same vulnerability that allows Marshall to be such a significant songwriter has also been her personal undoing. She's lived here on and off since 2003, but Miami isn't a city that typically calls to the moody, or the dark, or the purposefully self-destructive. There's all this light, to start.
